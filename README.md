steamengine_build_url:

# Checksum of the build. Should be in the following format : "<algorithm>:<checksum>"
# No default value, mandatory if steamengine_build_url is set.
steamengine_build_checksum:

# Project configuration.
# No default value and not mandatory.
steamengine_project_configuration:

# Name of the project default configuration file.
# File content is merged with steamengine_project_configuration variable.

Example Playbook
------------

Examples for different project types can be found under the molecule folder:
* [Node.js](molecule/nodejs/playbook.yml)
* [Play](molecule/play/playbook.yml)
* [SpringBoot](molecule/springboot/playbook.yml)
* [Static](molecule/static/playbook.yml)
* [Tomcat7](molecule/tomcat7/playbook.yml) 

Development
------------

This role use the [molecule framework](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in order to simplify the development process.

Requirements:
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

Setup your local environnement with python virtualenv prior to using molecule :

```virtualenv ~/.virtualenv/steamengine && source ~/.virtualenv/steamengine/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt```

Use ```molecule converge -s <project_type>``` to create a local environnement and ```molecule login -s <project_type>``` to log into the test machine.

Before any commit ensure that every test are passing with ```molecule test --all```
